It's a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. I will try and keep these pretty short and digestible. So if you don't have a cup of coffee go and grab one and if you do, let's get to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"previous-week\">Previous Week</h2>\n<h3 id=\"live-stream\"><strong>Live Stream</strong></h3>\n<p>This week I ran my very first live stream and while I was a little bit nervous I was really happy with the way everything turned out. I have been saying for a while now that I wanted to start live streaming and I finally stopped coming up with excuses and jumped right in. I want to thank all of you who took time out of your day to join me. It is much easier to do these live sessions with an interactive audience.</p>\n<p>In this live stream, I started by giving the current state of web application architecture types. Then we dove into what static site generators are and spent a little bit of time on what the \"JAM Stack\" is.</p>\n<p>Finally, we wrapped up by looking at a VueJS static site generator called Gridsome. This is the framework I used to build my new site and I have been impressed with it. I walked you through setting up your first Gridsome site and I showed you the start of how you could build your own blog.</p>\n<p>If you weren't able to make the live stream the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEBTiMpvgas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">recording is posted on YouTube</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blog\"><strong>Blog</strong></h3>\n<p>This week I also  <a href=\"https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/07/23/website-new-features-improvements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">wrote an article</a> on new features and improvements to my website. These were a series of new features that I have been working on and I was excited to get these out there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-week\">Upcoming Week</h2>\n<p>I am still working on a schedule for live streaming but here are a few topics I have in mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a Newsletter archive to my website</li>\n<li>Building a Gridsome Starter with my blog theme</li>\n<li>Vuex Intro</li>\n<li>Vue Function Based Component API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have an idea for something you would like to see me cover in a live stream please feel free to reach out to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"around-the-web\">Around the Web</h2>\n<p>These are things I found cool around the web this week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"articles\">Articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-an-animal-adoption-site-with-node-and-vue-part-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Building an Animal Adoption Site with Node and Vue - Part 1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"videos\">Videos</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/348717993\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sarah Drasner on Let's Write a Vue App From Scratch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9bSmxnx-O0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CJ on Build a Hacker New Client with the Vue 3 Function Based Component API</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devmode.fm/episodes/new-awesomeness-coming-in-vuejs-3-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">New awesomeness coming in Vue.js 3.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/vov-071-gridsome-with-gift-egwuenu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gridsome with Gift Egwuenu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/creating-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Command Line Heroes: Season 3: Creating JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">curl parrot.live</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/danvega/Coffee-Code-1-07-28-2019-cfc553c3953a4e989688ceb9942d511b#9a65ac73276a474cba39d96959c1bd22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vue-function-api</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/u3u/vue-hooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vue-hooks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"courses\">Courses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/dev-tools-and-debugging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Level Up Tutorials: DevTools &#x26; Debugging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/javascript-es2019-in-practice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Egghead.io: JavaScript ES2019 in Practice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conferences\">Conferences</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.javascriptandfriends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript &#x26; Friends</a> August 02, 2019</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"follow-this-person\">Follow This Person</h3>\n<p>This is someone I really enjoy following on Twitter and I think you should check them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisoncode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/chrisoncode</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"until-next-week\">Until Next Week</h2>\n<p>Thanks for sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee with me my friend.
