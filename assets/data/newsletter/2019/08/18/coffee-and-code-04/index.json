This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"previous-week\">Previous Week</h2>\n<p>This week I started a discussion on dev.to called \"<a href=\"https://dev.to/therealdanvega/what-is-your-conference-talk-walkup-song-36kb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">What is your conference walk up song</a>\". I thought it was an interesting idea and if you have a chance I would love to hear what yours would be. Other than that I don't have any new articles to share with you but I do have some pretty exciting news. I have some very cool projects in the works that should help get my writing in front of more people which should lead to helping out a lot more people.</p>\n<p>I told you that I got accepted to freeCodeCamp last week. This week I also had a really good meeting with someone who I instantly clicked with in the Vue community. I am going to be working on some content with him and I sent out this cryptic tweet to let everyone know what I was working on. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1161620722445410304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1161620722445410304</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"live-stream\"><strong>Live Stream</strong></h3>\n<p>No live stream this week but I did send this tweet out that I would love your thoughts on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1162351000440725506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1162351000440725506</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-week\">Upcoming Week</h2>\n<p>Now that our summer cohort students have graduated at <a href=\"https://www.techelevator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tech Elevator</a> I think things should quiet down over the next month. I will be working on the 2 big articles I told you about earlier and trying to lock down a live streaming schedule.</p>\n<p>PS - It's my birthday Wednesday so if you want to say hi on Twitter that would make an old man feel loved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"around-the-web\">Around the Web</h2>\n<p>These are things I found cool around the web this week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"articles\">Articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.bitsrc.io/vue-js-3-future-oriented-programming-54dee797988b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">VueJS 3.0 - Future-Oriented Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"videos\">Videos</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9uDghYuld4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Raymond Camden: Vue JS Introduction and tutorial</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/growing-your-skills-and-career-through-teaching-with-ali-spittel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chats with Kent Season 1 (14 Episodes)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hanselminutes.com/696/the-pragmatic-programmer-celebrates-20-years-with-dave-thomas-and-andy-hunt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hanselminutes: The Pragmatic Programmer celebrates 20 years.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"courses\">Courses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CcGwsqRpSM3w9BT_21tUU8JN2SnyckR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Adam Wathan: Designing with Tailwind CSS Playlist (15 videos)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://flexboxfroggy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flexbox Froggy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.hasura.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GraphQL Tutorials from Hasura</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"follow-this-person\">Follow This Person</h3>\n<p>This is someone I really enjoy following on Twitter and I think you should check them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/raymondcamden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Raymond Camden</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"until-next-week\">Until Next Week</h2>\n<p>Thanks for sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee with me my friend.
