{"data":{"newsletter":{"title":"Coffee & Code Newsletter: #3","date":"08/11/2019","content":"<p>Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, <a href=\"https://www.danvega.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ricky Januari</a>. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"previous-week\">Previous Week</h2>\n<p>A couple of months ago I applied to become an author for <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">freeCodeCamp</a> and this weekend I received the following email that I am so excited to share with you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"freecodecamp-email.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>I have been a huge admirer of what freeCodeCamp does for our community and I can't wait to start contributing. A huge thanks to Quincy Larson for approving my application. Now the real question is what should my first article be about? If you have any thoughts please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealdanvega\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tweet at me</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blog\">Blog</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/08/08/css-grid-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Learn how to use CSS Grid with a FREE tool CSS Grid Generator</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"css-grid-generator-cover.png\"></p>\n<p>As someone who has been developing web applications for almost 20 years now, I have seen it all. I started in FrontPage, moved to Dreamweaver, nested tables inside of tables and learned how to float and clear fix everything.</p>\n<p>While you won't see any awards for my designs on my bookshelf I am able to create some very nice simple and clean layouts. That said I have never really enjoyed it because it has always been a huge pain in the a\\$\\$. I have always felt like I was just hacking away until my layout looked almost like what I had in mind.</p>\n<p>This is why when tools like¬†<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CSS Grid</a>¬†&#x26;¬†<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flexbox</a>¬†came along I was beyond excited about the possibilities of creating clean layouts. I think if you combine these 2 technologies along with just how far JavaScript has come it is what has really got me excited about front end development these days.</p>\n<p>While I have a pretty good understanding of CSS Grid at this point I know it can be a little bit confusing to get started. That is why I am really excited to share with you a new tool that I came across that I really think can help you out if you're trying to understand CSS Grid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/08/08/css-grid-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Continue Reading</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"youtube\">YouTube</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vO8FTNyHww\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Installing Java with SDKMan</a></p>\n<p>Nothing new this week in video format so I am pulling this one from my archives. One of my favorite tools around is called SDKMan. In this tutorial, I introduce you to SDKMan and how to use it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"learning\">Learning</h3>\n<p>Listen, I realize that I have a problem and I'm ok with it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I love learning new things and when I found out about a new(ish) JavaScript framework for the server I just had to check it out. This week I finally had a chance to play around with <a href=\"https://nestjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NestJS</a>. While I didn't build anything that exciting I was able to produce a CRUD application that talked to a MongoDB database.</p>\n<p>This might sound a little strange given the fact that they are not the same tech stacks but It felt a lot like using Spring Boot. I was able to get something done quickly and I feel like NestJS enables me to be a more productive developer. If you're interested in learning more about NestJS or have your opinions about it please reach out to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"around-the-web\">Around the Web</h2>\n<p>These are things I found cool around the web this week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"articles\">Articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/firstclown/should-you-always-use-getters-in-vuex-4p0c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Should you always use getters in Vuex?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/raymondcamden/drag-and-drop-file-upload-in-vue-js-11kd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Drag &#x26; Drop File Upload in VueJS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"videos\">Videos</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFmYL75RleM&#x26;list=WL&#x26;index=17&#x26;t=0s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Getting Started with Vuetify 2.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkwHUyV-YY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Behind the scenes with Coding Train</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devmode.fm/episodes/webpack-inside-out-with-sean-larkin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">devmode.fm: Webpack inside and out with Sean Larkin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/vov-073-contributing-to-open-source-with-debbie-obrien/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Contributing to open source with Debbie O'Brien</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/71af117a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Real Talk JavaScript: Long time Java &#x26; GO to First time with JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tailwind.run/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tailwind.run()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tornis.robbowen.digital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tornis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"follow-this-person\">Follow This Person</h3>\n<p>This is someone I really enjoy following on Twitter and I think you should check them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sarah Drasner</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"until-next-week\">Until Next Week</h2>\n<p>Thanks for sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee with me my friend.
